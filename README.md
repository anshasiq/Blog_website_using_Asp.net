# Bloggie Project

Bloggie is a simple ASP.NET Core MVC web application created for **learning purposes**.  
It demonstrates how to structure a modern web project with controllers, models, views, repositories, and services.  
This project is not intended for production use — it’s a personal exercise to practice software architecture, coding patterns, and database migrations.
